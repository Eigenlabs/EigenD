This setup is distributed by Eigenlabs with the EigenD software and is designed for use with the Eigenharp Alpha only. It contains one keygroup with 35 destinations (13 instruments and 22 'control' modes) and two Arrangers (the EigenD step sequencer). Controls to record and unplay/cancel recording as well as changing the octave are provided at the base of the keygroup.

There are also two Audio Units and an EigenD delay connect to Mixer effect sends, and each instrument contains an inline audio unit effect. The Eigenharp Alpha headphone output is connected to a mixer send, and the microphone input is connected to a regular mixer channel.
