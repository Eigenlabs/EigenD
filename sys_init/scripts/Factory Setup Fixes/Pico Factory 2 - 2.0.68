description
    This script fixes an inconsistent state that recorders could have gotten
    into using EigenD 2. It requires EigenD 2.0.70 to run and the setup should
    either have been based on Pico Factory Setup 2 of EigenD 2.0.64 or all other
    factory setup fix scripts should have been applied beforehand.
