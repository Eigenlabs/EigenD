description
    This script fixes an inconsistent state in the browser that makes it
    exhibit odd behaviour when browsing to the audio and midi ports.

    The Browser must be running when you run this script.
    
    It requires EigenD 2.0.72 to run and the setup should
    either have been based on Pico Factory Setup 1 of EigenD 2.0.64 or all other
    factory setup fix scripts should have been applied beforehand.
