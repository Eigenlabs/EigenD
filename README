Issues
------
If you have any issues either building or running EigenD, 
please report these on the eigenlabs forum
     http://www.eigenlabs.com/forum/
     
The forum is read by many eigenharp players (as well as Eigenlabs),
and you will get a faster response than, posting to issues on github
which is only subscribed to by a small number.

Build requirements
==================

Runtime Files
-------------

You will need to have the stock EigenD installed to get the
runtime support (which is a vanilla Python install) and the
Windows device drivers.

Steinberg SDK
-------------
obtains from : http://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developers.html
you will need to register a developer account buts its free

You will need to obtain the VST headers from the Steinberg site.  
Then, place these in a sub directory under the EigenD directory called 'steinberg' e.g.

    ...
    steinberg/pluginterfaces/base/*
    steinberg/pluginterfaces/vst2.x/*
    ...
    steinberg/public.sdk/source/*
    ...

(under mac osx, its easier to create a symbolic link in the EigenD directory to the steinberg SDK directory)

Windows
-------
Visual Studio 2012, including Express - (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34673)
NSIS v2.94 - (http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis)
WiX 3.9- (wixtoolset.org)
Direct X SDK (June 2010) - (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812)

note: links are subject to change

general notes:
currently EigenD is using an older version of python, hence the reason we use the runtime supplied
currently the build is using a version of SCons that is not compatible with VS2013


MacOSX
------

XCode 5 or Xcode command line tools (https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/) 
updated ctags, not really required but will remove 'error' you see at end of build 

Linux
-----

you will need these packages

build-essential
libiw-dev
libfreetype6-dev
libx11-dev
libxext-dev
libxcursor-dev
libasound2-dev
libxinerama-dev
mesa-common-dev

please note: linux build is highly experimental, and libs required may be subject to change.
It would be very much appeciated if you build for linux,and have better instructions on requirements.
