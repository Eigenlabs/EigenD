Building EigenD
---------------

In order to build EigenD, simply type 'make' in this directory,
or './bld.cmd' on windows.  All build products will be placed
in a tmp/ directory off the top level.

Under windows, EigenD is tmp/bin/eigend.exe, under MacOS it's
an application bundle in tmp/app/EigenD.app

-------------

You will need to have the stock EigenD installed to get the
runtime support (which is a vanilla Python install) and the
