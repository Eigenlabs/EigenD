Building EigenD
---------------

In order to build EigenD, simply type 'make' in this directory,
or './bld.cmd' on windows.  All build products will be placed
in a tmp/ directory off the top level.

Under windows, EigenD is tmp/bin/eigend.exe, under MacOS it's
an application bundle in tmp/app/EigenD.app

In order to build, you will need the following:

Runtime Files
-------------

You will need to have the stock EigenD installed to get the
runtime support (which is a vanilla Python install) and the
Windows device drivers.

Steinberg SDK
-------------

You will need to obtain the Asio and VST headers from the
Steinberg site.  Place these in a directory called
'steinberg' as follows:

    asio.h
    asiodrvr.h
    asiosys.h
    combase.h
    iasiodrv.h
    pluginterfaces/vst2.x/aeffect.h
    pluginterfaces/vst2.x/aeffectx.h
    pluginterfaces/vst2.x/vstfxstore.h

Windows

Visual Studio 2008
NSIS
WiX
Direct X SDK (June 2010)

MacOSX
------

The Apple development kit, with the 10.4 build support installed.

Linux
-----

build-essential
libiw-dev
libfreetype6-dev

Non GPL Agents
---------------

As of Release 2.0.35, Agents are deployed into their own directories.
Certain Agents are not currently GPL'd and are not included in this
tree.   Currently, only the Audio agent is not GPL'ed.

You can still run setups which use these agents by copying the Agent
directory from a release into your tmp/plugins directory.

On a Mac:

  cp -r /usr/pi/release-2.0.35-experimental/plugins/plg_audio tmp/plugins

On Windows:

  Use whatever method to copy the plg_audio directory to tmp/plugins.
  The plg_audio directory will be found at:

  Program Files (x86)\Eigenlabs\release-2.0.35\plugins (64 bit systems)
  Program Files\Eigenlabs\release-2.0.35\plugins (32 bit systems)
