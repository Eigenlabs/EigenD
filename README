Issues
------
If you have any issues either building or running EigenD, 
please report these on the eigenlabs forum
     http://www.eigenlabs.com/forum/
     
The forum is read by many eigenharp players (as well as Eigenlabs),
and you will get a faster response than, posting to issues on github
which is only subscribed to by a small number.

or './bld.cmd' on windows.  All build products will be placed
