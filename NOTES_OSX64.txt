HOWTO
=====

running :
download Python 2.7.10 i386/x86_64, from python.org and install Python 2.7.10 (see notes for why)
(note: this will work with both 64 and 32 bit version of eigenD)

cd /usr/local/pi
mv Python.Framework Python.Framework.eigenlabs
ln -s /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework .
cp -R /usr/local/pi/Python.framework.eigenlabs/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/* /usr/local/pi/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages

to build:
export BUILD_TARGET=x86_64
make


NOTES
====
- Python , EigenD runtime, ships with only 32bit Python (2.7.10), so we need to install the 32/64 bit version from Python.org
(use 2.7.10 at the moment since Ive not tested 2.7.12) . we then need python packages used by EigenD, so I simply copied them

- Carbon is not supported on 64 bit

- there is no bit bridging, and wont be(!), so the 64 bit version cannot load 32bit VST/AU, use something like Bidule/Vienna Ensemble Pro, JBridge etc


TODO
====
we can't do a universal build, since most of eigenD is store in /usr/local/pi... 
so to allow both to exist we would need separate directories for 64 and 32 build.
need to consider if this is worth the 'overhead' since most users will use 32bit or 64bit
