NOTES
====
- tools/darwin_tools , change i386 to x86_64

- python 
we need 64 bit version of 2.7.10  ... from python.org
I assume I copied site-packages from /usr/pi/Python.Framework to  /Library/Python.Framework
I then link /usr/local/pi/Python.Framework to /Library/Python.Framework (so you can rename the EigenLabs supplied ones)

lib_juce, cannot support carbon , so in appconfig  - JUCE_SUPPORT_CARBON 0



TODO
====
reading setup files 
change above to be OPTIONAL dependent on env variable

research : looking into universal binary... this requires 2 builds, and we need to then see how to get it to link and package
