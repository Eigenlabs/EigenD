	/**
	  C++ equivalent to the Cocoa API class: NSNetService.
	 cf http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSNetService_Class/Reference/Reference.html
	 
	 The NetService class represents a network service that your application publishes or uses as a client. 
	 This class and the NetServiceBrowser class use multicast DNS to convey information about network services to and from your application. 
	 The API of NetService provides a convenient way to publish the services offered by your application and to resolve the socket address for a service.
	 
	 The types of services you access using NetService are the same types that you access directly using BSD sockets. 
	 HTTP and FTP are two services commonly provided by systems. 
	 (For a list of common services and the ports used by those services, see the file /etc/services.) 
	 Applications can also define their own custom services to provide specific data to clients.
	 
	 You can use the NetService class as either a publisher of a service or as a client of a service. 
	 If your application publishes a service, your code must acquire a port and prepare a socket to communicate with clients. 
	 Once your socket is ready, you use the NetService class to notify clients that your service is ready. 
	 If your application is the client of a network service, you can either create an NetService object directly 
	 (if you know the exact host and port information) or you can use an NetServiceBrowser object to browse for services.
	 
	 To publish a service, you must initialize your NetService object with the service name, domain, type, and port information. 
	 All of this information must be valid for the socket created by your application. 
	 Once initialized, you call the publish method to broadcast your service information out to the network.
	 
	 When connecting to a service, you would normally use the NetServiceBrowser class to locate the service on the network and obtain the corresponding NSNetService object. 
	 Once you have the object, you proceed to call the resolveWithTimeout: method to verify that the service is available and ready for your application. 
	 If it is, the addresses method returns the socket information you can use to connect to the service.
	 
	 The methods of NetService operate asynchronously so that your application is not impacted by the speed of the network. 
	 All information about a service is returned to your application through the NetService object’s listener. 
	 You must provide a listener object to respond to messages and to handle errors appropriately.
