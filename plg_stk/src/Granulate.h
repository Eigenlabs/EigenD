/*! \class Granulate
    \brief STK granular synthesis class.

    This class implements a real-time granular synthesis algorithm
    that operates on an input soundfile.  Currently, only monophonic
    files are supported.  Various functions are provided to allow
    control over voice and grain parameters.

    The functionality of this class is based on the program MacPod by
    Chris Rolfe and Damian Keller, though there are likely to be a
    number of differences in the actual implementation.

    Granular synthesis allows for time-stetching without affecting

    Each grain is defined as having a length of \e duration
    milliseconds which must be greater than zero.  For values of \e
    rampPercent (0 - 100) greater than zero, a linear envelope will be
    applied to each grain.  If \e rampPercent = 100, the resultant
    grain "window" is triangular while \e rampPercent = 50 produces a
    trapezoidal window.  In addition, each grain can have a time delay
    of length \e delay and a grain pointer increment of length \e
    offset, which can be negative, before the next ramp onset (in
    milliseconds).  The \e offset parameter controls grain pointer
    jumps between enveloped grain segments, while the \e delay
    parameter causes grain calculations to pause between grains.  The
    actual values calculated for each grain will be randomized by a
    factor set using the setRandomFactor() function.

  /*!
    This random factor is applied when all grain state durations
    are calculated.  If set to 0.0, no randomness occurs.  When
    randomness = 1.0, a grain segment of length \e duration will be
    randomly augmented by up to +- \e duration seconds (i.e., a 30
    millisecond length will be augmented by an extra length of up to
    +30 or -30 milliseconds).
