/*! \class BlowHole
    \brief STK clarinet physical model with one
           register hole and one tonehole.

    This class is based on the clarinet model,
    with the addition of a two-port register hole
    and a three-port dynamic tonehole
    implementation, as discussed by Scavone and
    Cook (1998).

    In this implementation, the distances between
    the reed/register hole and tonehole/bell are
    fixed.  As a result, both the tonehole and
    register hole will have variable influence on
    the playing frequency, which is dependent on
    the length of the air column.  In addition,
    the highest playing freqeuency is limited by
    these fixed lengths.

    This is a digital waveguide model, making its
    use possibly subject to patents held by Stanford
    University, Yamaha, and others.

    Control Change Numbers: 
       - Reed Stiffness = 2
       - Noise Gain = 4
       - Tonehole State = 11
       - Register State = 1
       - Breath Pressure = 128
