# Unfortunately not all EigenD headers are exported, this means that we cannot use utility functioins
# this directory contains useful parts of EigenD, that there is no need to rewrite.
# this code is under open source so is free to use
# NOTE: the code may have been modified slightly, so that it can work outside the EigenD build context
