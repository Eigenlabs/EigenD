This is a collection of work-in-progress primitive agents to massage the data
that's flowing through EigenD.

At this point the agents and the code here is mainly intended as examples and
documentation for developers that want to contribute to EigenD. These agents are
not part of the public EigenD and Belcanto functionality and are not guaranteed
to continue to behave or to exist.
