<h3 class="section">9.1 Installation on Unix</h3>

<p>FFTW comes with a <code>configure</code> program in the GNU style. 
Installation can be as simple as:
<a name="index-configure-362"></a>
<pre class="example">     ./configure
     make
     make install
</pre>
   <p>This will build the uniprocessor complex and real transform libraries
along with the test programs.  (We recommend that you use GNU
<code>make</code> if it is available; on some systems it is called
<code>gmake</code>.)  The &ldquo;<code>make install</code>&rdquo; command installs the fftw
and rfftw libraries in standard places, and typically requires root
privileges (unless you specify a different install directory with the
<code>--prefix</code> flag to <code>configure</code>).  You can also type
&ldquo;<code>make check</code>&rdquo; to put the FFTW test programs through their paces. 
If you have problems during configuration or compilation, you may want
to run &ldquo;<code>make distclean</code>&rdquo; before trying again; this ensures that
you don't have any stale files left over from previous compilation
attempts.

   <p>The <code>configure</code> script chooses the <code>gcc</code> compiler by default,
if it is available; you can select some other compiler with:
<pre class="example">     ./configure CC="<i>&lt;the name of your C compiler&gt;</i>"
</pre>
   <p>The <code>configure</code> script knows good <code>CFLAGS</code> (C compiler flags)
<a name="index-compiler-flags-363"></a>for a few systems.  If your system is not known, the <code>configure</code>
script will print out a warning.  In this case, you should re-configure
FFTW with the command
<pre class="example">     ./configure CFLAGS="<i>&lt;write your CFLAGS here&gt;</i>"
</pre>
   <p>and then compile as usual.  If you do find an optimal set of
<code>CFLAGS</code> for your system, please let us know what they are (along
with the output of <code>config.guess</code>) so that we can include them in
future releases.

   <p><code>configure</code> supports all the standard flags defined by the GNU
Coding Standards; see the <code>INSTALL</code> file in FFTW or
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards_toc.html">the GNU web page</a>. 
Note especially <code>--help</code> to list all flags and
<code>--enable-shared</code> to create shared, rather than static, libraries. 
<code>configure</code> also accepts a few FFTW-specific flags, particularly:

     <ul>
<li><a name="index-portability-364"></a><code>--enable-portable-binary</code>: Disable compiler optimizations that
would produce unportable binaries. <b>Important:</b> Use this if you are
distributing compiled binaries to people who may not use exactly the
same processor as you.

     <li><code>--with-gcc-arch=</code><i>arch</i>: When compiling with <code>gcc</code>, FFTW
tries to deduce the current CPU in order to tell <code>gcc</code> what
architecture to tune for; this option overrides that guess
(i.e. <i>arch</i> should be a valid argument for <code>gcc</code>'s
<code>-march</code> or <code>-mtune</code> flags).  You might do this because the
deduced architecture was wrong or because you want to tune for a
different CPU than the one you are compiling with.  You can use
<code>--without-gcc-arch</code> to disable architecture-specific tuning
entirely.  Note that if <code>--enable-portable-binary</code> is enabled
(above), then we use <code>-mtune</code> but not <code>-march</code>, so the
resulting binary will run on any architecture even though it is
optimized for a particular one.

     <li><a name="index-precision-365"></a><code>--enable-float</code>: Produces a single-precision version of FFTW
(<code>float</code>) instead of the default double-precision (<code>double</code>). 
See <a href="Precision.html#Precision">Precision</a>.

     <li><a name="index-precision-366"></a><code>--enable-long-double</code>: Produces a long-double precision version of
FFTW (<code>long double</code>) instead of the default double-precision
(<code>double</code>).  The <code>configure</code> script will halt with an error
message is <code>long double</code> is the same size as <code>double</code> on your
machine/compiler.  See <a href="Precision.html#Precision">Precision</a>.

     <li><a name="index-threads-367"></a><code>--enable-threads</code>: Enables compilation and installation of the
FFTW threads library (see <a href="Multi_002dthreaded-FFTW.html#Multi_002dthreaded-FFTW">Multi-threaded FFTW</a>), which provides a
simple interface to parallel transforms for SMP systems.  By default,
the threads routines are not compiled.

     <li><code>--enable-openmp</code>: Like <code>--enable-threads</code>, but using OpenMP
compiler directives in order to induce parallelism rather than
spawning its own threads directly.  Useful especially for programs
already employing such directives, in order to minimize conflicts
between different parallelization mechanisms.  Use either
<code>--enable-openmp</code> or <code>--enable-threads</code>, not both; in either
case the multi-threaded FFTW interface/library (see <a href="Multi_002dthreaded-FFTW.html#Multi_002dthreaded-FFTW">Multi-threaded FFTW</a>) is compiled (with different back ends).

     <li><code>--with-combined-threads</code>: By default, if <code>--enable-threads</code>
or <code>--enable-openmp</code> are used, the threads support is compiled
into a separate library that must be linked in addition to the main
FFTW library.  This is so that users of the serial library do not need
to link the system threads libraries.  If
<code>--with-combined-threads</code> is specified, however, then no separate
threads library is created, and threads are included in the main FFTW
library.  This is mainly useful under Windows, where no system threads
library is required and inter-library dependencies are problematic.

     <li><a name="index-Cell-processor-368"></a><code>--enable-cell</code>: Enables code to exploit the Cell processor
(see <a href="FFTW-on-the-Cell-Processor.html#FFTW-on-the-Cell-Processor">FFTW on the Cell Processor</a>), assuming you have the Cell SDK. 
By default, code for the Cell processor is not compiled.

     <li><a name="index-Fortran_002dcallable-wrappers-369"></a><code>--disable-fortran</code>: Disables inclusion of Fortran-callable
wrapper routines (see <a href="Calling-FFTW-from-Fortran.html#Calling-FFTW-from-Fortran">Calling FFTW from Fortran</a>) in the standard
FFTW libraries.  These wrapper routines increase the library size by
only a negligible amount, so they are included by default as long as
the <code>configure</code> script finds a Fortran compiler on your system. 
(To specify a particular Fortran compiler <i>foo</i>, pass
<code>F77=</code><i>foo</i> to <code>configure</code>.)

     <li><code>--with-g77-wrappers</code>: By default, when Fortran wrappers are
included, the wrappers employ the linking conventions of the Fortran
compiler detected by the <code>configure</code> script.  If this compiler is
GNU <code>g77</code>, however, then <em>two</em> versions of the wrappers are
included: one with <code>g77</code>'s idiosyncratic convention of appending
two underscores to identifiers, and one with the more common
convention of appending only a single underscore.  This way, the same
FFTW library will work with both <code>g77</code> and other Fortran
compilers, such as GNU <code>gfortran</code>.  However, the converse is not
true: if you configure with a different compiler, then the
<code>g77</code>-compatible wrappers are not included.  By specifying
<code>--with-g77-wrappers</code>, the <code>g77</code>-compatible wrappers are
included in addition to wrappers for whatever Fortran compiler
<code>configure</code> finds. 
<a name="index-g77-370"></a>
<li><code>--with-slow-timer</code>: Disables the use of hardware cycle counters,
and falls back on <code>gettimeofday</code> or <code>clock</code>.  This greatly
worsens performance, and should generally not be used (unless you don't
have a cycle counter but still really want an optimized plan regardless
of the time).  See <a href="Cycle-Counters.html#Cycle-Counters">Cycle Counters</a>.

     <li><code>--enable-sse</code>, <code>--enable-sse2</code>, <code>--enable-altivec</code>,
<code>--enable-mips-ps</code>:
Enable the compilation of SIMD code for SSE (Pentium III+), SSE2
(Pentium IV+), AltiVec (PowerPC G4+), or MIPS PS.  SSE, AltiVec, and MIPS PS
only work with <code>--enable-float</code> (above), while SSE2 only works in double
precision (the default).  The resulting code will <em>still work</em> on
earlier CPUs lacking the SIMD extensions (SIMD is automatically
disabled, although the FFTW library is still larger).
          <ul>
<li>These options require a compiler supporting SIMD extensions, and
compiler support is still a bit flaky: see the FFTW FAQ for a list of
compiler versions that have problems compiling FFTW. 
<li>With the Linux kernel, you may have to recompile the kernel with the
option to support SSE/SSE2/AltiVec (see the &ldquo;Processor type and
features&rdquo; settings). 
<li>With AltiVec and <code>gcc</code>, you may have to use the
<code>-mabi=altivec</code> option when compiling any code that links to FFTW,
in order to properly align the stack; otherwise, FFTW could crash when
it tries to use an AltiVec feature.  (This is not necessary on MacOS X.) 
<li>With SSE/SSE2 and <code>gcc</code>, you should use a version of gcc that
properly aligns the stack when compiling any code that links to FFTW. 
By default, <code>gcc</code> 2.95 and later versions align the stack as
needed, but you should not compile FFTW with the <code>-Os</code> option or the
<code>-mpreferred-stack-boundary</code> option with an argument less than 4. 
</ul>

   </ul>

   <p><a name="index-compiler-371"></a>To force <code>configure</code> to use a particular C compiler <i>foo</i>
(instead of the default, usually <code>gcc</code>), pass <code>CC=</code><i>foo</i> to the
<code>configure</code> script; you may also need to set the flags via the variable
<code>CFLAGS</code> as described above.
